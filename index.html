        <h1 class="center">DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH</h1>
        <h3>Presented by Group C (2BABTOS)</h3>
       <p class="p1"> The possiblity and sustainability of decent work and economic growth starts from the home: A healthy and functional home.
        For health is wealth! </p>
        <p> If we must work, we must first be healthy, if we must have decent work, we must first have decent homes.
        For an individual is only a function of his home and environment and the economy of a nation is only a mirror of her homes and environments .
        </p>
        
   <p class="p2"> The United Nations economic and social council has defined "decent work" to be (Wikipedia): Employment that "respects the fundamental rights of the human person as well 
       as the rights of workers in terms of conditions of work safety and remuneration, respect for the physical and mental integrity of the worker in the 
       exercise of his/her employment."</p>
       <p class="p3">The United Nations definition of "decent work" is relatable in every human society.
        Bringing the message home to our community, we see that the message of human rights, workers welfare (especially safety and timely
         renumeration) are hardly observed or respected in our society today.
        Sales boys/girls are never to be sick for their absent days will be deducted from their salaries.</p>
    <p class="p4">Civil servants go through similar experiences during their time in service and after decades of service in varying man-made and natural 
      conditions, they still have to go through rigorous exercises and unnecessary waiting periods before they have their arrears/pension paid 
      in their feeble,fragile and often unhealthy state, before they have their arrears and pension paid.
      These inhuman treatments are carried out by government or coporate employers of labour who exploit their workers rights and well being for their own selfish gains.
        Whatever be the excuse of such unfair abuse of workers and human rights, by the employers of labour is not as important as the foundational causes.</p>
        "The real culprit is the home and environment" where a person who was once a child with a heart as clean as a slate was raised to become an adult who probably was never taught or lost his/her
        <ol>
            <li>Love for humanity</li>
            <li>Moral values</li>
            <li>Respect for human rights &</li>
            <li>Dignity</li>
        </ol> 
        From psychologists, we learn that the behavior of a man is the sum total of
        "Nature and Nurture".
        Simply put:
        <ul>
            <li>Nature is how we were born "genetic behavior"</li>
            <li>Nurture is how we were raised "learned behavior"; influenced by the home and environment</li>
        </ul>
    
        Not much can be done with regards to our nature or genes, but alot can be done with regards to nurture.
        Nurture: care, training or upbringing.
        <ul>
                <li>The indecent/dishonest yahoo boy/girl, the Agbero, prostitute or armed robber and</li>
                <li>The decent/honest civil servant, Banker or entrepreneur, are all products of Nurture and Nature.</li>
        </ul>
        
        The difference is that some were nurtured in a positive home or environment and the others nurtured or influenced negatively and so grew to be decent or indecent citizens, according to our topic. Both Decent or Indecent workers positively and negatively contribute to the economy.
        Weather positively or negatively, the only thing constant is "change".
        <p class="p5"> In Warri today,one hardly walk freely with phones and other valuables without the fear of being robbed. Even in broad day light.Equally a problem is illicit drug use which has seen the end of many young and promising teenagers/youths.
         Early sexual involvement and unwanted pregnancies are all signs of Nurture gone wrong.
        Our only hope for a better Warri is change:</p>
        Change in the way we are, change in the way we raise our children, change in the motive/choice of spouse, change in our reasons for having children, change in everything we do, change for a better child, a better family, community and nation. Change for a better world.
       <p class="p6"> The family as the bedrock of every society begs for our collective attention.
        The child, mother and father.
        In the campaign for
        "Decent work and Economic growth" for all,
        Number 8 of the United Nations SDGs(sustainable development goals), we present possible solutions.
        
        Creating awareness and bringing possible solutions through "Solutions Journalism": A monthly "online magazine" for especially Children (teens) that will communicate help or assistance to the lot of us who find ourselves consumed or limited by everyday challenges in life, more so challenging because of the peculiarities with our homes, communities and dear country Nigeria.
        The goal of the magazine is to be like a mobile mum, where readers can be nurtured through various phases of life. With pop-up contents that will take them through HOLISTIC CARE for everyday growth and development so the family as a unit and individuals can arrive at a place of wholeness where everyone is healthy enough to function and positively influence our "societies-economic situation,  Through decent work"!
        Through networking with one another, we can be sure the magazine will be a means of respiration, especially for young people, where they can exhale wastes/toxic materials like confusion, loneliness, unproductivity, illetracy, depression, anxiety, loss of self, ignorance, high risk behaviours, domestic abuses, adverse childhood experiences... And inhale our "holistic approach" to possible solutions to these issues and so much more;
        
        Once again, our simple formulae is: "Networking to play mum" Since mum's job is a responsibility that never ends, we bring our Strenghts together to share</p>
